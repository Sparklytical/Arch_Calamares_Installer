The ezmaint script attempts to collect various common maintenance tasks that help keep an Arch based system healthy and lean. Below is the menu of the script and the individual functions that perform the actions.

 EZArcher Maintenance Script
-------------------------------------

  1) Failed systemd services
  2) Check journal logs
  3) Cleanup journal space
  4) Run system update
  5) Clean package cache
  6) Check for orphan packages
  7) Remove orphan packages
  8) Cleanup user cache folder
  9) Regenerate mirrorlist

  X) Exit

Enter your choice: 


1. Failed systemd services:

  systemctl --failed > /tmp/failedsrvs
  nano /tmp/failedsrvs

These commands list any failed systemd services and pipe the output into a temporary file that is opened in the nano editor for your viewing. If all output looks OK, closing the nano editor with Ctl+X will return to the main menu. If there are issues, you can copy and paste the suspect lines into a search engine for further review and take appropriate action.

2. Check journal logs:

  journalctl -p 3 -xb > /tmp/journalchk
  nano /tmp/journalchk

These commands list any journal entries and pipe the output into a temporary file that is opened in the nano editor for your viewing. If all output looks OK, closing the nano editor with Ctl+X will return to the main menu. If there are issues, you can copy and paste the suspect lines into a search engine for further review and take appropriate action.

3. Cleanup journal space:

  journalctl --vacuum-time=2weeks

This command will removed any journal logs older than two weeks and free up space.

4. Run system update:

  pacman -Syu

This command will perform a full system upgrade.

5. Clean package cache:

  pacman -Scc

This command will perform an aggressive cleaning of the package cache and ask to remove all package cache contents for poth installed and uninstalled packages. If you wish to roll-back packages, this option should not be used.

6. Check for orphan packages:

  pacman -Qtdq > /tmp/orphanchk
  nano /tmp/orphanchk

These commands list any orphaned packages and pipe the output into a temporary file opened in the nano editor. If all output looks OK, closing the nano editor with Ctl+X will return to the main menu. If there are issues, you can copy and paste the suspect lines into a search engine for further review and take appropriate action.

7. Remove orphan packages:

  pacman -Rns $(pacman -Qtdq)

This command will remove all orphaned packages listed from the orphan package check in option of this ezmaint tool.

8. Cleanup user cache folder:

  read -p "Type your user name, be exact, and press Enter: " USERCACHE
  rm -rf /home/$(USERCACHE)/.cache/*

These commands will ask for a username and then delete all contents of the user's .cache folder. The .cache folder typically contains temporary working files of the desktop and user programs. The contents of the .cache folder can be examined by opening the file manager and viewing hidden files inside the user's home folder in the .cache folder. Please review the files to be deleted before using this option if you are concerned or just curious.

9. Regenerate mirrorlist:

  reflector --age 6 --latest 20 --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

This command runs reflector and generates a new mirrorlist file based on the options specified in the command. My defaults are to select the twenty most recently updated within the last six hours that are hosted on https servers and sort them by speed. Please look at the man page for reflector if you want to change the options.

I hope these various functions come in handy. I must give credit to EF Tech Made Simple for his inspiration in the choice and implementation of these functions. Please view his video describing these maintenance tips here: https://youtu.be/wwSkFi3h2nI
