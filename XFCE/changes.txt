- Enable NetworkManager:
Symbolic link to NetworkManager.service located at /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/

- DNS (systemd-resolved):
Symbolic link to systemd-resolved located at /etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/

- lightdm:
Symbolic link to lightdm.service localted at /etc/systemd/system/ named display-manager.service

- Default graphical target:
Nothing needed to be done, it goes straight to the login page.

- The ISO name, label, etc. that where on the build.sh script are now on the file called profiledef.sh,
the file was added with one of the updates to archiso.

- User, password and groups:
Automated in steps.sh. You can change the variables of the username, password for the regular user, and password for root
in steps.sh.

- Localization:
You can customize your keyboard layout inside the script. It creates vconsole.conf and xorg conf file.

For the language you can use the locale.gen file in the template, i created a systemd service called localegen.service
that executes a script that generates the locales on boot (localegen.sh, located at /usr/bin/).
I don't know if that's the best way to do it, but it works.
I tried it with spanish and english (both keymap and locale) and it seems to work fine.

- Mirrorlist:
The mirrorlist update command is in steps.sh

- Sudo:
I added the sudoers file with normal permission, so that i can create the zip file without root permission.
It's permission gets updated when you run the steps.sh script.
It's configured so that sudo asks for the root password instead of the user password.

And lastly, the mkarchiso command is in steps.sh, it's the last command.
The steps.sh script needs root permission, to copy the sudoers file and to execute mkarchiso.

I tested it with different languages, different user and password and it seems to work fine, but im sure it needs more
testing. Sorry if i made any mistakes writing, english is not my native language.
