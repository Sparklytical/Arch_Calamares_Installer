#  Arch-calamares-installer

Set of scripts to generate your own Arch Linux installer that uses Calamares to install

These set of scripts are taken from [EzArch(https://sourceforge.net/projects/ezarch/) and made more customized for separate versions to make it easy for you to configure your own Distro Flavor easily.

## Todo

 - [ ] Add support to pre-install Pamac-aur.
 - [ ] Enable support for AUR directly in ISO to install things like yay otherwise the first TODO won't be possible.
 - [ ] Trim down the packages listed to bare minimum but necessary.
 - [ ] Fix faults in KDE_TEST and move it to KDE(stable)
 - [ ] Do same with rest flavors.
